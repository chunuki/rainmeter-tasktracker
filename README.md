## 5 BUTTONS:	REFRESH, RESET, ADD TASK, TASK FILE, AUTO SORT
- REFRESH:		For errors. Use if tasks did not sort properly.
- RESET:		Removes non-recurring completed tasks.
- ADD TASK:		Add new task for today.
- TASK FILE:	Manually modify, add or remove today's or future tasks.
- AUTO SORT:	When enabled, auto sorts upon completing tasks.

## Recurring Tasks:
- Tasks that do not get removed through RESETs.
- Make a task recurring by adding "|R" at the back
- e.g.	Non-recurring task
		Recurring task|R

## Timed Tasks: Tasks that arrange themselves in chronological order when sorted.
- e.g.	0900 Timed task
		1000 Another timed task

## THINGS TO TAKE NOTE OF
I'm kind of trash so there's no functionality to add dates and tasks for future dates, so use TASK FILE to manually add stuff in.
